## Inspiration
> Just a small quick idea to make for a small demonstration and in a low cost.

## Working and Build
> The build details will be uploaded in this [link](#) soon. The code used, along with the import details will be here.
> The Code is built on the PlatformIO platfrom on VS Code. Hence the additional files

## Note
> You need to load `New Ping` and `Servo` libraries from the PlatformIO library manager before running. More details about PlatformIO [here](https://platformio.org)

>This Project was made for the Dept. of Robotics & Automation, SNU
